## One Definition of Open Science 

> The principles of open science are to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, available, and reproducible. Advances in technology, including collaborative tools and cloud computing, help enable open science, but technology alone is insufficient. **Open science requires a shift to a more transparent and collaborative scientific process, which will increase the pace and quality of scientific progress.**

## Flavours of Open Science {visibility="hidden"}

**Checklist Open Science:** what we do to satisfy requirements of funding agencies and publishers.  
            - Put data and code in public repositories

  
  
**A kinder Science:** transparancy and collaboration.  
            - Collaborate through co-working sessions and hackathons  
            - Actively share tips and tricks for working with data and code  
            - Give back by participating in open source software development

```{.python}
import earthaccess
import xarray as xr

earthaccess.login()

results = earthaccess.search_data(
    short_name='ATL06',  # ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Land Ice Height
    bounding_box=(-10, 20, 10, 50),  # Only include files in area of interest...
    temporal=("1999-02", "2019-03"),  # ...and time period of interest.
    count=10)

files = earthaccess.download(results, "/tmp/my-download-folder")

# Or 
files = earthaccess.open(results)
ds = xr.open_mfdataset(files)
```

## Fast efficient data access

To take full advantage of the cloud we need cloud optimized data

## Follow Best Data Practices

Humans _analyze_ the data but machines have to _read_ the data.  And machines are dumb, so help them out.

::: {.small}
- Use standard file formats
- Common filename structures
- Follow conventions (Tidydata, CF)
- Include essential metadata and attributes
